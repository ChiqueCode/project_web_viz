Analysis. 

I have created a Python script to visualize the weather of 500+ cities across the world of varying distance from the equator. I utilize Python,  OpenWeatherMap API, Pandas, numpy & Mlatplotlib along with other libraries.

Conclusions.

* As expected, the weather becomes significantly warmer as one approaches the equator (0 Deg. Latitude). More interestingly, however, is the fact that the southern hemisphere tends to be warmer this time of year than the northern hemisphere. This may be due to the tilt of the earth.
* The temperature of cities located North of the equator experience lower temperatures compared to cities located South of the equator. In addition, the futher away North the city is from the equator, the lower the temperature is.
* There is no strong relationship between latitude and cloudiness. However, it is interesting to see that a strong band of cities sits at 0, 80, and 100% cloudiness.
* There is no strong relationship between latitude and wind speed. However, in northern hemispheres there is a flurry of cities with over 20 mph of wind.
* There appears to be no correlation with the city's cloudiness factor and its' latitude.
* There is no strong relationship humidity and latitude. About 60% appears to experience 50% or even more humidity.
